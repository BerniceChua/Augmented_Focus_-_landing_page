This is the public-facing landing page.  If you want to see the actual code for this, please request permission to this private repo:  https://github.com/BerniceChua/Augmented_Focus/

Before playing, please make sure that you have ample space to move around, and that you are in a safe area with no people or things that could obstruct your movement or injure you.  

## How To Play
1) Hold the mobile device as if holding a camera to take pictures.  (Don't block the camera lens.)
2) Move the mobile device to scan for the hummingbird.
3) Once the hummingbird is found and in the center of the screen, the timer starts.
4) Move the phone to follow the hummingbird for as much time as possible.
5) When the hummingbird leaves the view of the screen, it is game over.

## About
"Augmented Focus" uses an Android phone's built-in camera and built-in sensors (specifically the gyroscope) for the AR to orient the phone and the game piece.  

This is my second project working with 'markerless' augmented reality and using the phone sensors.  

I took the foundations of what I learned from [Dizzy](https://github.com/BerniceChua), and expanded on the gameplay while refactoring/improving the code.  

("Augmented Focus" is just the temporary name, since I haven't thought of a good name yet.  This game is still in closed beta as of now, and will get more features and improvements.)

I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH: Before playing, please make sure that you have ample space to move around, and that you are in a safe area with no people or things that could obstruct your movement or injure you.

## Issues
### To-Dos & Stretch Goals:
1. Keeping score & tracking time properly (completed).  
2. Choose a font that fits the mood better.  (getting feedback from closed beta)
3. UI & UX improvements - add option to adjust or mute the music & sounds. (completed)
4. UI & UX improvements - aethetics/color.  (getting feedback from closed beta)
5. Add creature sounds (OPTIONAL)
6. Add difficulty levels (easy = slower speed and less variations in movement, medium = a bit faster speed and slightly more variations in movement, difficult = very fast movement speeds and a wide variation in movement).
7. Add "Relax Mode"
8. Add different creatures (other flying creatures? but more likely other species of hummingbirds) to choose from? (OPTIONAL)
